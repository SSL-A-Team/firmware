This script enables smart firmware flashing, allowing the controlling device to
query whether the peripheral device is up-to-date or needs to be flashed.
This script embeds the various firmware image hashes into both the device that
flashes and the device that gets flashed. Since the wheel, dribbler, and kicker
firmware binaries are included inside the control board binary, all of the
firmware hash values can be injected by searching through and modifying only the
control board image. The hash of the various firmware images is taken before the
hash values are injected into the binary, so the stored hash value is zeroed
out for the computation.
